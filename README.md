# Mobilithon Project: Generative AI for Enhanced Mobility  

This repository contains the code and resources for our submission to **i.mobilothon 4.0**, organized by **Volkswagen Group Technology Solutions India**. Our project leverages **Generative AI (GenAI)** to innovate and improve the mobility experience through advanced machine learning and user-friendly interfaces.  

---

## Introduction  

Mobility is evolving, and so are user expectations. In this project, we explore the potential of **Generative AI** to address key challenges in the automotive and mobility ecosystem. By integrating AI-powered solutions into a scalable application, we aim to enhance customer experiences, enable real-time insights, and demonstrate the power of cutting-edge technologies in the mobility domain.  



## Features  

- **AI-Generated Outputs**: Utilizes pre-trained models to generate intelligent responses and predictions.  
- **Interactive User Interface**: An intuitive web application designed to provide seamless interaction.  
- **Pre-trained Models Integration**: Incorporates JOLIB models for accurate and efficient processing.  
- **Static Resources**: Enhanced UI with carefully chosen visuals and images for better user experience.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Flexible codebase allowing easy scalability and future extensions.  



## Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9  
- **Framework**: Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning**: JOLIB for model persistence  
- **Static Assets**: Images and templates for UI design
